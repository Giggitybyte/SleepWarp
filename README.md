Instead of skipping directly to day when sleeping, time will speed up based on how many players are sleeping.

**When enabled in the config file, block entities and chunks can also be ticked more often while sleeping to simulate the passage of time.**

> # Archived
> I've been very busy nowadays and I've lost interest in modding Minecraft in my spare time, so I've decided to archive this project.
> 
> The `development` and `1.20.x` branches are unstable as a result of experimentation with multithreading ticks.
> All other branches (`1.19.x` and older) were a written lot simipler and are stable in single player but playing on multiplayer isn't the best experience.
>
> If you wish to fork this project or reference any code in this repository, feel free to do so. All I ask is that you respect the [license](https://github.com/Giggitybyte/SleepWarp/blob/development/LICENSE).
